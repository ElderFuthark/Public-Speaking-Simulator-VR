# Virtual Reality Final Project: Public Speaking simulator

This repository contains my final project for the VR class I took. It was my first foray into VR development beyond simple proof of concept assignments. The game was built using Unity and utilized the Oculus Rift. Due to some bugs with the Oculus Integration asset package and the latest version of Unity (2018.3.11f1) not integrating with it properly, my group and I had to fall back to Unity version 2018.2.21f1.

**Note:** Sometimes cloning the project and opening it in Unity produces errors pertainging to asset imports. I'm not certain why this is happening. If I delete the project and reclone it, it usually opens fine.
